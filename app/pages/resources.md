### Backcountry Access & Winter Permit System
- A [Winter Permit](https://parks.canada.ca/pn-np/bc/glacier/visit/hiver-winter/ski) is required for all backcountry users in Glacier National Park.  
- A national park pass is required to access the park. The pass can be purchased at the Rogers Pass Discovery Centre or online.  
- Before heading out into the backcountry, it is important to check which areas and parkings are open today on the [Rogers Pass Backcountry Access](https://www.pc.gc.ca/apps/Rogers-Pass) interactive map.

### Maps & Books
#### GeoBackcountry Rogers Pass
[GeoBackcountry Rogers Pass](https://www.geobackcountry.com/ ) is a great resource for backcountry skiing in Rogers Pass. The book is available for purchase online and in local shops. It provides detailed information on the terrain and backcountry routes in the area.

####  Glacier National Park Winter Terrain Atlas
[Low resolution (PDF 15 MB)](https://pcweb2.azureedge.net/-/media/pn-np/bc/glacier/WET4/visit/winter/ski/atlas/en-terrain-atlas-2019-web.pdf)  
[High resolution (PDF 73 MB)](https://pcweb2.azureedge.net/-/media/pn-np/bc/glacier/WET4/visit/winter/ski/atlas/en-terrain-atlas-2019-large.pdf)  

The Winter Terrain Atlas provides valuable visual terrain information to backcountry users of Mount Revelstoke and Glacier national parks. It is designed to provide a common language for place and run names and to assist with trip planning and rescue situations. The Winter Terrain Atlas also helps backcountry users identify Winter Permit Area boundaries.

### Avalanche Safety
Avalanche Canada provides daily avalanche forecasts for the Glacier National Park area. It is important to check the forecast before heading out into the backcountry. Avalanche Forcast can be found on the [Avalanche Canada](https://www.avalanche.ca/) website.

A good knowledge of avalanche safety is essential when venturing into the backcountry. Avalanche Canada offers a variety of courses to help you learn about avalanche safety. [AvySavvy](https://avysavvy.avalanche.ca/en-ca) is an online resource that provides free avalanche safety training. It is a great way to start.

It is strongly recommended to have at least the Avalanche Skills Training 1 (AST 1) course before heading into the backcountry. The AST 1 course provides an introduction to avalanche safety and teaches you how to recognize avalanche terrain, understand the avalanche bulletin, and perform a companion rescue. The AST 2 course is a more advanced course that builds on the skills learned in the AST 1 course. It covers topics such as advanced snowpack analysis, terrain selection, and group management. The AST 2 course is recommended for those who spend a lot of time in the backcountry and want to improve their avalanche safety skills.

### Road Conditions
Trans-Canada Highway (Highway 1) is the main highway that runs through Glacier National Park. It is important to check the road conditions before heading out into the backcountry. The [DriveBC](https://drivebc.ca/) website provides up-to-date information on road conditions, road closures, and construction along Highway 1.

### Weather Forecast
The weather in the mountains can change rapidly. It is important to check the weather forecast before heading out into the backcountry.  
Ressources include:
- [Avalanche Canada's Mountain Weather Forecast](https://www.avalanche.ca/weather/forecast): Detailed weather forecast for mountain regions.
- [Environment Canada](https://weather.gc.ca/) : Short-term weather forecasts.
- [Windy](https://www.windy.com/): Weather forecast and wind map, different weather models available.
- [SpotWX](https://spotwx.com/): Weather forecast for specific locations, different weather models available.

### Radio Communications
Cellular service is limited in the backcountry. It is recommended to carry a radio for communication in case of emergency.
FRS (Family Radio Service) and GMRS (General Mobile Radio Service) are two-way radio services that are available for use in Canada. FRS radios are limited to 0.5 watts and have a maximum range of 2 miles. GMRS radios are more powerful and have a maximum range of 5 miles. You can find the list of FRS and GMRS frequencies on the [RadioReference Wiki](https://wiki.radioreference.com/index.php/FRS/GMRS_combined_channel_chart) website. Store-bought radios are pre-programmed with these frequencies.  

Glacier National Park has a repeater on 166.380 MHz. I have not been able to find more information about this repeater, but it is likely used by Parks Canada staff for communication in the park.
